              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Jack & Jill Toy Shop was founded by childhood friends Jack Thompson and Jill Martinez, 
                who shared a passion for creating magical childhood experiences. What started as a small 
                local toy store has grown into a beloved destination for families seeking high-quality, 
                educational, and fun toys.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that play is essential for a child's development. That's why we carefully 
                select every toy in our collection, ensuring they meet the highest standards of safety, 
                quality, and educational value. From traditional wooden toys to innovative STEM kits, 
                we have something special for every child.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we're proud to serve families not just in our local community, but around the 
                world through our online store. Our mission remains the same: to bring joy, learning, 
                and wonder to children everywhere.
